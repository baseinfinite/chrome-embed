## !THIS IS NOT MY PR0XY!
This uses the rammerhead proxy.
# FAQ
## What is this?
This is a github pages iframe website of the rammerhead website. This github repo allows you to embed rammerhead to google sites and other sites with less chance of it being blocked.
## What do you mean "less chance"?
I mean less chance by, if the main repo gets blocked, you can easily fork it to make it unblocked.
## What if it shows "This page has been blocked by chrome" or "Connection timed out"?
That means that the site hosting the rammerhead pr0xy has been blocked by your system admin, which I cant do anything about that. I may be able to add other embeddable pr0xies in the future, though.
## What is the arrow in the top right corner?
The arrow allows you to open the pr0xy in an about:blank cloaked site. This means, that your system admin will not be able to see what you are up to with their pre-installed spyware.
## Its really slow for me.
Its just like that sometimes.
## How do I add it to my google sites?
How you add any other site. I have an example site right here. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/web-embed-example/home">example</a>
